This is another paragraph.
With a line break.

How about some **bold**? Or perhaps some *italics*? ***Both***?

Maybe some inline `co\de`?

```python
# Python more your style?
print('Hello, World!')
``` 
```js
// What about js?
console.log('Hello, World!');
``` 
```java
// Some java?
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

Pros of Haskell:
- Pure Functional Programming
- Strong, Static Type System
  - Excellent Abstractions
  - Great for Compilers and DSLs
    - Lazy Evaluation
- High Performance (when tuned)
- Rich Ecosystem for Academic and Research-Grade Tools

Cons of Haskell:
1. Steep Learning Curve
2. Laziness Can Be Tricky
3. Smaller Ecosystem
4. Cryptic Error Messages
5. Dependency Hell in Some Ecosystems
6. Smaller Community and Hiring Pool
