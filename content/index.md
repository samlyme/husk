Pros of Haskell:
- Pure Functional Programming
- Strong, Static Type System
- Excellent Abstractions
- Great for Compilers and DSLs
- Lazy Evaluation
- High Performance (when tuned)
- Rich Ecosystem for Academic and Research-Grade Tools

Cons of Haskell:
1. Steep Learning Curve
2. Laziness Can Be Tricky
3. Smaller Ecosystem
4. Cryptic Error Messages
5. Dependency Hell in Some Ecosystems
6. Smaller Community and Hiring Pool
