markdown -> html, written in haskell

## devlog
- early dev, decided on supporting "basic sytanx" in markdown
  - code blocks should be fenced
  - horizontal rules
  - us semantic html like <strong> and <em>
- mainly building out the required html
- code syntax highlighting should be done with highlight.js


- problem: input should either be escaped text or an html structure. Should be solved using a data type.
- Weird styles can be acheived. I will just let it be.
