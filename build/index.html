    <h1>Imperative vs Declarative code</h1>
    <p>The most fundamental difference between imperative and
    declarative code is that imperative code tells the computer
    <em>how</em> to achieve a certain goal, while declarative code
    tells the computer <em>what</em> a certain goal is, and the
    computer will achieve that goal for you. Another way to
    conceptualize this is that with declarative code, the computer
    "knows" what the goal is, while with imperative code, the
    computer doesn't know what the end goal is, and is simply
    following your instructions.</p>
    <p>Imagine you have a robot that can make you sandwiches. You
    tell the robot "make me a PB&amp;J sandwich." The robot obliges
    and makes you a PB&amp;J. Here, the command that you gave the
    robot was <strong>declarative</strong> because it told the
    robot <em>what</em> goal to achieve.</p>
    <p>If instead, you told the robot "Put a piece of bread on a
    plate. Spread peanut butter on that piece of bread. Get another
    piece of bread and put it on the plate. Spread jelly on that
    piece of bread. Put the pieces of bread together." the command
    that you gave the robot was <strong>imperative</strong> because
    the robot does not know what the end goal is, and is just
    following your instructions.</p>
    <p>When writing imperative code, you are
    <strong>instructing</strong> the computer to get it to perform
    a task, while with declarative code, you are
    <strong>describing</strong> the task, or in other words,
    <em>declaring</em> the your intent.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Let's say you have an array of strings in JS, and your goal
    is to print out all strings to the console.</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-js">const arr = ["Apple", "Banana", "Pear"];

// Imperative for-loop
for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
 console.log(arr[i]);
}

// Declarative for-loop
arr.forEach(
 (s) =&gt; console.log(s)
);
</code></pre>
    <p>The first example is imperative because you are instructing
    the computer to iterate through the array and print out the
    item at each index, however that program segment doesn't "know"
    the end goal, which is to print out every string in array
    <code>arr</code>. The program only knows to go to each index in
    the array and print out the value. Only you know the end goal,
    and the code "trusts" you to correctly implement that goal.</p>
    <p>The second example is declarative because you tell the
    computer to print out each item in the array <code>arr</code>.
    The code "knows" the end goal, and the you place trust in the
    computer that it knows how to handle that goal.</p>
    <h2>Pros and cons of each</h2>
    <p>Because imperative code places trust in the developer, it is
    more prone to human error.</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-js">// The end condition will cause an array out of bounds error
for (let i = 0; i &lt;= arr.length; i++) {
 console.log(arr[i]);
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Using <code>i &lt;= arr.length</code> is an extremely common
    "off by one" error. This only happens because the computer
    trusts that the developer can implement a specific goal
    correctly.</p>
    <p>However, the greater trust placed in the developer also
    allows for greater power for the developer. For example, if
    developer needs to access multiple items in an array in one
    iteration, imperative code will almost always be written.</p>
    <p>Imagine you need to print out the sum of consecutive
    integers in an array. The imperative implementation is fairly
    simple.</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-js">const arr = [43, 57, 87, 94, 23, 87];

// Imperative
for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length - 1; i++) {
 console.log(arr[i] + arr[i+1]);
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Because imperative code places more trust on the developer,
    it is often more versatile, but can also be more error-prone.
    On the other hand, because declarative code places less trust
    in the developer, it is less error prone, but can be limited by
    the features of the programming language.</p>
    <h2>Stateful data</h2>
    <p>Because imperative code deals with <em>how</em> a goal is
    being accomplished, the management of the data's state is left
    to the developer. The developer is trusted with ensuring that
    the state of the data is valid.</p>
    <p>For example, in an imperative for-loop iterating over an
    array, the state of the loop variable determines where in the
    array a particular iteration of the loop will access. The
    developer is trusted with properly managing the state of that
    loop variable to achieve the end goal.</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-js">const arr = [43, 57, 87, 94, 23, 87];

// The bounds and management of the state of i is up to you!
for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
 // Some code...
}

// You can even set i to an invalid value and break the program!
for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
 i = -1;
 console.log(arr[i]);
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Because the code doesn't know what the end goal of the code
    is, it can't assume anything that you are doing is wrong.</p>
    <p>In comparison, iterating over an array using a declarative
    for-loop places zero trust in the developer to manage the loop
    variable. The declarative for-loop has a goal, and it will
    achieve that goal, and the developer is not allowed to
    interfere.</p>
    <pre><code class=
    "language-js">// This gives the developer less trust so now they can't break it if they tried.
arr.forEach(
 (s) =&gt; console.log(s)
);
</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>.forEach</code> loop has a clear goal. Its goal is
    to iterate over each element, so the computer knows what to do.
    Because the computer knows what to do, the developer is not
    allowed to interfere.</p>
    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction is when a complex set of operations are bundled
    together so that they can be used with less effort.</p>
    <p>This is code to find the GCD between two numbers
    <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code>.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const num1 = 252;
const num2 = 105;

let a = Math.abs(num1);
let b = Math.abs(num2);

// Calculate GCD
while (a &gt; 0 &amp;& b &gt; 0 &amp;& a != b) {
 if (a &gt; b) {
  a-=b;
 }
 else {
  b-=a;
 }
}

const GCD = a || b;
</code></pre>
    <p>In this (contrived) example, the developer that needs
    <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code> needs to understand how
    the GCD calculation works.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">// in index.js
import findGCD from "./utils.js";

const num1 = 252;
const num2 = 105;
const GCD = findGCD(num1, num2);
</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-js">// in utils.js file
export default function findGCD(num1, num2) {
   let a = Math.abs(num1);
   let b = Math.abs(num2);
   while (a &gt; 0 &amp;& b &gt; 0 &amp;& a !== b) {
      if(a &gt; b){
         a-=b;
      }else{
         b-=a;
      };
   };
   return a || b;
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Here, the functionality for finding GCD is abstracted into a
    function. The name of the function gives other devs a clear
    indication to the "end goal" of the function. Other devs can
    now declaratively state that they would like the GCD between
    two numbers, without having to understand the implementation
    themselves.</p>
    <p><strong>In a sense, by abstracting away code complexity, we
    make our code "more declarative". However, this code can't be
    considered truly declarative.</strong></p>
    <h3>Abstraction Cont</h3>
    <p>This idea of abstraction is applied everywhere in
    programming. When you declare a variable, the computer will
    actually find space in memory, allocate that space, then give
    access to that memory to the current program thread.</p>
    <p>This process is <em>abstracted</em> away from the developer.
    The developer places trust in the computer that it will
    accomplish the goal of creating a variable, instead of the
    computer placing trust in the developer to properly manage
    memory.</p>
    <p>The more abstractions, the "higher level" the language. A
    "high level" language is filled with these abstractions, while
    a "low level" has less of these abstractions.</p>
    <p>Low level languages place more trust in the developer,
    similar to how imperative code places more trust in the
    developer, while high level languages place less trust in the
    developer, similar to how declarative code places less trust in
    the developer.</p>
